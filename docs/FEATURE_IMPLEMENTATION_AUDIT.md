## Week 1 — Mentor Onboarding & Profile

| Feature | Status | Evidence | Missing pieces | Notes / Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LinkedIn social sign-in (auto-fill profile data) | 🟡 Partial | OmniAuth gems added (`omniauth`, `omniauth-linkedin-oauth2`, `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection`), Devise configured with `:omniauthable`, Identity model created, callback controller implemented, UI buttons added to sign-in/sign-up pages, routes configured. | LinkedIn OAuth app credentials (`LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` and `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables need to be configured). | Implementation complete - requires LinkedIn developer app setup and credential configuration to activate. |
| Mentor profile fields (expertise, availability, etc.) | ✅ Implemented | `app/models/user_profile.rb` defines the fields and validations; `app/controllers/mentor_onboarding_controller.rb` / `app/views/mentor_onboarding/steps/*` render the multi-step forms. | — | Fields are wired end-to-end via the mentor onboarding controller. |
| Input validation on all steps | ✅ Implemented | `UserProfile` includes presence/format validations plus the custom `rate_or_pro_bono` rule and the views show error messages in each partial. | — | Validation flows are active for mentor onboarding. |
| Email + password sign-up | ✅ Implemented | Passwordless onboarding implemented via `OnboardingSubmission` model and custom confirmations; users register without password, confirm via email link, then set password on first login. `devise_for :users` in `config/routes.rb`, `pages/signup.html.erb`, and the `user_registration_path` form drive the flow. | — | Passwordless flow enhances security and UX; standard Devise sign-up adapted. |
| Forgot/reset password + strong password validation | ✅ Implemented | `User` includes `:recoverable`, `config/initializers/devise.rb` enforces `password_length = 6..128`, and Devise ships with reset/password views. | — | Works via Devise defaults. |
| Email confirmation | ✅ Implemented | `app/models/user.rb` enables Devise’s `:confirmable`, `OnboardingSubmission` model handles payload storage and application after confirmation, `app/controllers/users/confirmations_controller.rb` customizes auto-sign-in and redirects. `db/migrate/20251218020000_add_confirmable_to_users.rb` adds confirmation fields, and `db/migrate/20251224091500_create_onboarding_submissions.rb` creates submissions table. | — | Passwordless confirmation flow implemented; onboarding submissions trigger confirmation emails and apply user/profile data on confirmation. |
| Step-by-step profile wizard (progress indicator) | ✅ Implemented | `Founder::MentorOnboarding` controller’s `STEPS`, `progress` calculation, and `app/views/mentor_onboarding/show.html.erb` render the indicator plus step partials. | — | Wizard structure is rendered/end-to-end. |
| Save & exit | ✅ Implemented | Added `onboarding_step` column to `user_profiles` table, updated mentor and founder onboarding controllers to save/load current step, added `save_and_exit` actions with routes, added "Save & Exit" buttons to both onboarding flows with hidden forms to preserve current data. | — | Users can now save their progress and resume onboarding later from where they left off. |
| Mentor dashboard access (welcome message) | ✅ Implemented | `mentor/dashboard#show` renders `app/views/mentor/dashboard/show.html.erb` and `app/views/layouts/mentor_dashboard.html.erb` which include a welcome header. | — | Basic dashboard presence is live. |
| Left navigation panel (key areas) | ✅ Implemented | `app/views/shared/_mentor_sidebar.html.erb` renders Overview, Messages, Schedule, Startups, Profile, Settings, Support, and Logout links; included by the mentor layout. | — | All required links are present. |

---

## Week 2 — Mentor Dashboard UI & Functionality

| Feature | Status | Evidence | ❌ Missing pieces | Notes / Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Left navigation panel (Overview, Messages, My Schedule, My Startups, Profile, Settings, Support, Logout) | ✅ Implemented | `shared/_mentor_sidebar.html.erb` enumerates every required entry and is rendered from `layouts/mentor_dashboard.html.erb`. | — | The navigation is wired and styled with Tailwind. |
| Mentorship request: Accept | 🟡 Partial | `Api::V1::MentorshipRequestsController#respond` updates `MentorshipRequest` status to `accepted` and creates `MentorshipConnection`. | No mentor-facing controller/view/form that calls the endpoint; no reason UI. | Acceptance logic lives in the API but mentors cannot trigger it from the portal yet. |
| Mentorship request: Decline (+ optional reason) | 🟡 Partial | Same API endpoint accepts `status: declined` and notifies the founder. | No `decline_reason` column in `mentorship_requests`, no UI to capture a reason. | The sprint specifically asks for optional reasons; currently they are dropped. |
| Mentorship request: Reschedule (date/time selector + notification) | ✅ Implemented | Added `decline_reason`, `reschedule_reason`, `reschedule_requested_at`, and `proposed_time` columns plus a mentor portal controller/views for accept/decline/reschedule. The API now accepts `reschedule_requested` responses and notifies founders. | — | Mentors can suggest new times via `/mentor/mentorship_requests`, and founders receive notifications with the proposed slot. |
| Dashboard widgets | 🟡 Partial | `mentor/dashboard/show.html.erb` renders cards for Active Sessions, My Startups, Messages, but numbers are hardcoded (0) and not derived from data. | Hook the cards to actual session/conversation counts. | Stats do not yet reflect real data. |
| My Schedule enhancements (view startup, add to calendar, join link, availability, time slots) | 🟡 Partial | `MentorPortal::SessionsController` has stubbed `join` and `add_to_calendar` redirects, and `mentor/schedule/show.html.erb` is a placeholder. | Real schedule data, calendar export, session links, and view content. | UI exists but lacks functionality/data. |
| Feedback & rating system | ❌ Missing | No controller, view, or route ties `Rating` model to mentor sessions; only `Rating` exists for resources. | Rating controller/actions, views/forms, and notifications for mentor feedback. | Feedback pipeline absent. |
| My startups directory | 🟡 Partial | `MentorPortal::StartupsController` fetches startups via `MentorshipConnection`, but `mentor/startups/index.html.erb` never renders the `@startups` collection. | Template loops, detail cards, and fallback messaging. | Data retrieved but not displayed. |
| Edit profile, support page, logout | 🟡 Partial | `mentor/profiles/show`/`support/show` are placeholders; `mentor_sidebar` provides logout. | Edit form, support content, and actual settings management. | Feature scaffolding exists but lacks substance. |

---

## Week 3 — Founder Onboarding & Profile

| Feature | Status | Evidence | ❌ Missing pieces | Notes / Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder registration & authentication | ✅ Implemented | Passwordless onboarding implemented via `OnboardingSubmission`; Devise handles registration (pages/signup, user model, `devise_for` routes) and controllers redirect founders to `founder_root_path`. | — | Users register without password, confirm via email. |
| Forgot/reset password + strong password validation | ✅ Implemented | Devise’s `:recoverable` plus `config/initializers/devise.rb` `password_length` rule. | — | Works via Devise defaults. |
| Startup profile wizard: input validation | ✅ Implemented | `StartupProfile` now validates required fields plus URL formats, the onboarding wizard exposes a visibility toggle, and founders can update the flag in their profile settings. | — | All startup data is validated and founders can choose whether the profile is published via the new `profile_visibility` flag. |
| Startup profile wizard: privacy & visibility controls | ✅ Implemented | Added `profile_visibility` boolean column to `startup_profiles` table via migration, `startup_profile_params` permits the field, and UI toggle exists in onboarding wizard. Founders can now control profile discoverability. | — | Founders can choose whether their startup profile is public via the visibility toggle. |
| Startup profile wizard: save & exit | ✅ Implemented | Added `onboarding_step` column to `user_profiles` table, updated founder onboarding controller to save/load current step, added `save_and_exit` action with route, added "Save & Exit" button to founder onboarding flow with hidden form to preserve current data. | — | Founders can now save their progress and resume onboarding later from where they left off. |
| Email confirmation | ✅ Implemented | `User` model includes `:confirmable` from Devise, `OnboardingSubmission` handles founder onboarding payload, `app/controllers/users/confirmations_controller.rb` customizes flow. Founders must confirm email before accessing the app; onboarding submissions apply profile data. | — | Passwordless confirmation implemented for founders. |
| Step-by-step startup profile wizard (progress indicator) | ✅ Implemented | `FounderOnboardingController::STEPS`, view indicator, and submit flow for each step. | — | Progress tracker works. |
| Founder personal info fields | ✅ Implemented | `founder_onboarding/show` renders `full_name`, `phone`, `country`, `city`; `user_profile` stores them. | — | Fields wired to the model. |
| Startup details fields | ✅ Implemented | Startup step collects `startup_name`, `description`, `stage`, `target_market`, `value_proposition`. | — | Data saved to `StartupProfile`. |
| Professional background fields (sector, stage, funding stage) | ✅ Implemented | Professional step collects `sector`, `stage`, `funding_stage`, `funding_raised`. | — | Controlled by `FounderOnboardingController`. |
| Startup dashboard access + welcome message | ✅ Implemented | `founder/dashboard#show` renders welcome banner partial. | — | Dashboard accessible under `founder_root`. |
| Startup dashboard left navigation panel | ✅ Implemented | `shared/_founder_sidebar.html.erb` is used by `layouts/founder_dashboard.html.erb`. | — | Navigation is visible across founder routes. |

---

## Week 4 — Founders Dashboard Development

| Feature | Status | Evidence | ❌ Missing pieces | Notes / Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Left nav panel (functional + responsive) | ✅ Implemented | `founder_sidebar` and layout provide a responsive sidebar (hidden on small screens). | — | Navigation is rendered on all founder routes. |
| Milestones CRUD | ✅ Implemented | `Founder::MilestonesController`, views under `app/views/founder/milestones/*`, and index emphasize creation/editing. | — | CRUD flows complete. |
| Monthly tracker form (save + display) | 🟡 Partial | Controller/actions exist, but views reference `users`, `growth_rate`, `churn_rate`, `notes` whereas the table only stores `customers`, `runway`, `burn_rate`. | Either update schema with the referenced fields or align the views/params to the schema. | UI will break once `number_with_delimiter` runs on `nil` or undefined columns. |
| Progress charts/graphs | 🟡 Partial | Dashboard progress partial references `milestone.category` (not in schema) and `@milestones`, and there is no charting library. | Add `category` column or adjust view to existing fields; integrate chart component or data. | Displays static content and may crash on missing column. |
| Logout flow | ✅ Implemented | `shared/_founder_sidebar.html.erb` includes logout button, and `ApplicationController#after_sign_out_path_for` ensures logout redirects to root path (`/`). | — | Logout properly redirects users to the home page. |
| Top nav (avatar + bell) | ❌ Missing | `layouts/founder_dashboard.html.erb` has no top bar, avatar, or notification bell despite the sprint request. | Add header partial with avatar, bell, and links. | Lacks the requested top navigation. |
| Welcome banner | ✅ Implemented | `founder/dashboard/_welcome_banner.html.erb` renders message with founder name or email. | — | Banner present on dashboard. |
| Startup profile summary edit | 🟡 Partial | Summary shows data and links to `edit_founder_startup_profile_path`, but `startup_profile_params` in `Founder::StartupProfilesController` incorrectly permits `:name` instead of `:startup_name`, so updates silently fail. | Rename permitted param to `:startup_name` or update column; add tests. | Profile edits do not persist today. |
| Help/support links | 🟡 Partial | Sidebar includes `founder_support_path` and `founder/support` view exists but only shows placeholder text. | Provide real support content and contact methods. | Support page is skeletal. |
| Recommended mentors display | ✅ Implemented | Dashboard renders `@recommended_mentors = Mentor.limit(3)` with complete profile data including name, expertise, and company. Fixed field delegation in Mentor model and view templates. | — | Founders can now see recommended mentors with complete profile information. |
| View mentor profiles | ✅ Implemented | `Founder::MentorsController` plus views display full mentor profiles with bio, specialties, industries, experience, mentorship approach, and contact links. Fixed Mentor model delegation and view templates. | — | Founders can view detailed mentor profiles with all onboarding form data. |
| Request mentorship + booking flow + sessions display | ✅ Implemented | Added modal-based mentorship request flow with authentication checks. `Founder::MentorshipController#index` handles mentor pre-selection, `app/views/founder/mentorship/index.html.erb` renders modal form, and `Founder::MentorshipRequestsController` processes requests. Modal appears when clicking "Request Session" links. | — | Founders can now request mentorship sessions via modal forms with proper authentication flow. |

---

## Week 5 — Matching Algorithm

| Feature | Status | Evidence | ❌ Missing pieces | Notes / Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Match by challenge expertise | 🟡 Partial | `MatchingService#expertise_match` scores mentors based on `UserProfile.expertise` vs `StartupProfile.mentorship_areas`. | No UI surfaces these matches; controller call in `Api::V1::MatchesController` currently passes an extra keyword argument that will raise `ArgumentError`. | Scoring exists but cannot be triggered successfully. |
| Match by startup stage | 🟡 Partial | `MatchingService#stage_match` honors startup stage in the score. | Same as above; results are not shown to founders. | Stage-based matching is in the service but not consumed. |
| Match by funding stage | ❌ Missing | MatchingService ignores funding stage, and no other logic references `StartupProfile.funding_stage`. | Extend scoring to weigh `funding_stage` and surface it in match reasons. | Sprint requirement unmet. |
| Data sync | ❌ Missing | There is no background sync job or data pipeline; `MatchingService` relies solely on live user and startup profiles. | Add sync jobs/ETL if needed by the sprint. | No mechanism to keep mentor/founder data aligned for matching analytics. |
| Core matching logic | 🟡 Partial | The service exists and sorts matches, but `Api::V1::MatchesController` instantiation (`MatchingService.new(params[:founder_id], preferences: …)`) does not match `initialize(founder_id)` signature, so the endpoint crashes. | Update controller to call `MatchingService.new(founder_id)` (and optionally accept prefs) and expose reason data. | Endpoint currently raises `ArgumentError`, so matching API cannot be consumed. |
| Ranking & display | ❌ Missing | No controller/view renders match rankings for founders; the only call is the broken API. | Build a dashboard/listing page that prints `match[:score]` and reasons. | No founder-facing interface. |
| Edge-case handling | 🟡 Partial | `MatchingService` raises `RecordNotFound` when founder/startup/profile missing (handled in API with rescue). | Extend safeguards (e.g., mentor data gaps) and log mismatches. | Basic error handling is present but limited. |

---

## Week 6 — Subscription Payments

| Feature | Status | Evidence | ❌ Missing pieces | Notes / Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subscription tiers logic (backend access rules) | ❌ Missing | `Subscription` model only stores `tier`, `payment_method`, `status` and no access guards are enforced in controllers. | Tier definitions, policy checks, and database flags. | Unable to gate premium features. |
| Payment gateway integration | ❌ Missing | No payment gateway gem (Stripe/PayPal) in `Gemfile`, no service for creating charges. | Add payment gateway client, webhook handling, and integration tests. | Payments cannot be processed. |
| Subscription flow | 🟡 Partial | `Founder::SubscriptionsController` `new/create/show` exist, but `Subscription` table lacks fields referenced by the view (`plan_name`, `price`, `billing_cycle`, `next_billing_date`, `features`, `active`). | Extend `subscriptions` table, update view to render real data, and persist plan metadata. | Current view will fail when accessing missing attributes. |
| Payment modal (Card/PayPal/M-Pesa) | ✅ Implemented | Added interactive payment modal to `founder/subscriptions/new.html.erb` with card details form, PayPal option, and M-Pesa phone number input. Modal opens when plan is selected and includes JavaScript for payment method selection and form validation. | Payment gateway integration for actual processing. | Modal UI is complete and functional; requires backend payment processing integration. |
| Confirmation emails | ❌ Missing | No mailer or job is triggered after subscription creation. | Add mailer + view, trigger from controller or background job. | Users get no confirmation. |
| Receipt generation | ❌ Missing | No invoice/receipt generation logic or stored document. | Create renderer (PDF/HTML) and send via email. | Cannot prove payment. |
| Subscription management | ❌ Missing | No actions to update/cancel/renew subscriptions, no settings UI. | Implement edit/destroy flows and UI. | Users cannot change plans. |

---

## Week 7 — Programs Page

| Feature | Status | Evidence | ❌ Missing pieces | Notes / Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program cards (title, summary, primary category tag) | ✅ Implemented | `pages/programs/_program_list.html.erb` renders cards with title, description, and `program.category` tag. | — | Fully implemented. |
| Learn more → detail page/modal | ✅ Implemented | `pages#program_detail` action and `app/views/pages/program_detail/*` serve a hero, content parser, and CTA. | — | Works via `program_detail_path`. |
| Mobile responsiveness testing | ✅ Implemented | Comprehensive automated system tests with Capybara/Selenium across mobile (375x667), tablet (768x1024), and desktop (1920x1080) viewports. QA documentation with manual testing procedures and checklists. | — | All responsive layouts now formally validated with automated tests and documented QA procedures. |
| Programs page structure (all programs) | ✅ Implemented | `PagesController#programs` populates `@programs` and view renders them via partials. | — | Structure meets the requirement. |
| Content integration (text/images/videos) | ✅ Implemented | `Program` model stores `description`, `content`, `cover_image_url`, and the detail page renders text/images; no video field yet (not requested). | — | Content flow is active. |
| Program categorization (backend categories) | ✅ Implemented | `Program` migration includes `category`, and controller filters `PROGRAM_CATEGORIES` list. | — | Backend supports categories. |
| Filters by category | ✅ Implemented | `pages/programs/_category_filter.html.erb` toggles `params[:category]` and the controller filters `@programs`. | — | Filter UI works. |

---

## CI/CD & Deployment Tooling

| Feature | Status | Evidence | ❌ Missing pieces | Notes / Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Migration audit rake task | ✅ Implemented | `lib/tasks/migrations_audit.rake` scans all migration files for duplicate `add_column` and `add_index` operations, returns exit code 1 when duplicates found (perfect for CI/CD failure), and provides detailed output with file names and line numbers. | — | Prevents migration conflicts during deployment by catching duplicates before they cause issues. |
| Migration existence checks | ✅ Implemented | Updated existing migrations to include `unless column_exists?` and `unless index_exists?` checks to prevent duplicate column/index creation errors. | — | Migrations now safely handle re-runs and prevent deployment failures from duplicate operations. |

---

## Week 8 — Admin Dashboard Refactor

| Feature | Status | Evidence | Missing pieces | Notes / Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Modern admin dashboard layout (sticky nav, left sidebar, badges) | ✅ Implemented | `app/views/layouts/active_admin/application.html.erb` renders the sticky header with notifications, avatar, and collapsible sidebar powered by `app/assets/javascripts/controllers.js` and `AdminDashboardHelper`. | — | ActiveAdmin now matches the requested modern SaaS navigation experience. |
| Dashboard content (KPIs, activity feed, analytics, content updates) | ✅ Implemented | `app/views/active_admin/main/dashboard.html.erb` shows KPI cards, the activity feed, mentorship request table with inline actions, sparkline analytics, and marketing updates driven by `config/initializers/active_admin_dashboard.rb`. | — | The dashboard renders real data for requests, sessions, signups, and marketing content. |
| General UX polish (status tags, inline actions, breadcrumbs, progress/search controls) | ✅ Implemented | `AdminDashboardHelper#admin_status_tag`, breadcrumb bar, filter pills, and the search form are all wired into the layout so each view surfaces status indicators, inline controls, and contextual navigation. | — | Status tags, inline actions, and responsive filters are now available for the admin workspace. |

---

## Week 9 — Support Center

| Feature | Status | Evidence | Missing pieces | Notes / Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Support ticket submission form | ✅ Implemented | `Founder::SupportController#show/create`, `app/views/founder/support/show.html.erb`, and `SupportTicket` model capture subject/category/description and persist user requests. | Add workflow for admins to assign owners and close/resume tickets. | Tickets now validate and store full descriptions with status metadata. |
| Founder tracking dashboard | ✅ Implemented | Support page renders recent tickets with status badges, timestamps, and a quick link to RailsAdmin for the full inbox. | Pagination, filters, or per-ticket detail pages. | Founders see the six most recent tickets and statuses directly on the support page. |
| Admin notification + record | ✅ Implemented | `SupportTicketMailer` notifies `support@nailab.com`, ActiveAdmin lists the model under a dedicated Support navigation, and migration `20251219140357` stores all ticket fields. | SLA automation, escalation rules, audit trail detail. | Admins are alerted when a ticket is created and can review submissions inside ActiveAdmin. |
