## FEATURES.md (original)

```markdown
# Features

This document lists notable UI features and their current status.

- Admin layout: Filters pills ("Active", "Pending") — currently implemented in the admin layout but commented out for now (2026-01-09). These are located in `app/views/layouts/rails_admin/application.html.erb` and can be re-enabled by removing the HTML comment around the block.

- Admin Programs editor: Structured insert and preview — implemented and usable via `/admin/programs_page/1/edit`.

(Keep this document updated when UI features are toggled or removed.)
